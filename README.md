## Getting Started

In order to get started developing, you'll need to do a few things first.

1. Install all of the `node_modules` required for the package. Depending on the computer's configuration, you may need to prefix this command with a `sudo`.

```
npm install
```

or

```
sudo npm install
```

`yarn` can be used it is already installed

```
yarn install
```

or

```
sudo yarn install
```

2. Lastly, run the start command to get the project off the ground.

```
npm start
```

or

```
yarn start
```

3. Head over to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app live!

## File Structure

### build/

This is where application will be compiled. Assets, like images and fonts, should be placed directly within this folder. Also in this folder is a default `index.html` file for serving up the application.

### src/

The client folder houses the client application for project. This is where client-side Javascript components (and their directly accompanying styles) live.

## App Components

### api/

API directory contains the api calls which are triggering through the app. The purpose of api/ directory is to create an abstract layer for api with function with the paramters.

### components/

Components contains all the feature of blocks application page. Components should work like feature based widgets and should be rendered through the pages.

### config/

Config directory contains all the configurations of the app like app name, api base path, api routes etc.

### pages/

Pages contains all the application pages or top level components.

### store/

Store directory has the redux store configuration and root reducer of app.

### store/actions

Actions directory contain action-types, action-creators for each app module.

### store/reducers

Reducers directory contain reducers for each app module.

### store/sagas

Sagas directory contain sagas for each app module.

### store/selectors

Selectors directory contain memoized selectors for each app module.

### types/

Types directory any custom types by any part of application.

### utils/

Utilities that can be used by any part of application.
